name: Build and deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages

# Build and deploy the Jekyll site and publish to GitHub Pages when main branch is updated
# For user site repositories (username.github.io) GitHub Pages will serve the site from the root of the main branch,
# but this workflow builds the site and uses the Pages deployment actions to ensure consistent builds.
